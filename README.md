# minetest-mods
Minetest Mods based on kittens and Skittles. Does not contain kittens and Skittles.
This is a modpack with a bunch of my mods, and some other mods I want to save and am working on developing further.

Some of these mods have been forked from other sources, or backed up here so I can work with a version that won't be updated or changed too much.

<h1><blockquote>My Mods</blockquote></h1>

cheat = extra block combinations which can be used to create iron, coal, dirt, sand, gravel, lava, water, wood, and other needed items on the spot.

give_initial_stuff = Grants beginning player some good gear on startup.

ironcrafts = Adds ironstone, a block which changes the surrounding blocks to stone_with_iron

lavacrafts = Adds lavarock, a rock which liquifies anything next to it. Good for starting fires!

lavaerodes = It does a lot of little interesting things to blocks exposed to lava. Gravel immediately changes to lava. Stone erodes to cobblestone, which erodes to dirt, which eventually turns into flowing lava. Sand changes into glass, which turns into lava_source.

lavashrinks = This mod causes lava to slowly go away, turning lava_source into lava_flowing over time. This helpful to recover and see the aftermath from lava experiments.

mario = Extra blocks based on Super Mario video games appear. These can be mined for Super Mario items, which can be used for healing or combined together to produce some special pickaxes.

moregloop = This is my take on the original gloop mod that she started years ago. This mod only adds kalite, talinite, arol, alatro, and akalin blocks and ores to the game, along with respective picks. Picks are special powered to dual-function as shovel and sword.
If you are looking for Gloop Blocks by VanessaE, this isn't it! Her mod is far superior my mod in many ways.

obsidiancrafts = Adds two different obsidian picks to the game (very overpowered!)

tunnelmaker = Tweaked version of a mod I found on the Minetest forums. This mod is tweaked to make the floor of illuminated blocks that generally won't dissolve from my other lava mods.

watercrafts = Adds waterrock, a block that changes surrounding blocks to water_source


<h1><blockquote>Other Mods</blockquote></h1>

bettertnt = Old TNT mod that I tried tweaking. My suggestion is to just use the Nuke mod on minetest. It's updated and much better than this one.

caverealms = Backed up version of Cave Realms Lite.

str_helpers = Needed for several of the scripts above.
