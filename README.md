# minetest-mods
Minetest Mods based on kittens and Skittles. Does not contain kittens and Skittles.

This is a modpack with a bunch of my mods, and some other mods I want to save and am working on developing further.

<align=center><blockquote>Descriptions of mods</blockquote></align>

bettertnt = Makes mining a blast!

bridgetool = Perfect for constructing a bridge or stiarcase without needing to enter fly mode.

cheat = extra block combinations which can be used to create iron, coal, dirt, sand, gravel, lava, water, wood, and other needed items on the spot.

creativeinv = A far better creative inventory

give_initial_stuff = edited original give_initial_stuff mod included in minetest. Grants beginning player the following gear: wood and stone pickaxe, 10 torches, and 10 wood

inventory_plus

mario = Extra blocks based on Super Mario video games appear. These can be mined for Super Mario items, and combined together to produce a special pickaxe with incredible powers.

melting = Lava does weird things with this mod...

moregloop = My take on the original gloop mod. Adds kalite, talinite, arol, alatro, and akalin blocks and ores to the game, along with respective picks. Picks are special powered to dual-function as shovel and sword.

str_helpers = Needed for several of the scripts above.
